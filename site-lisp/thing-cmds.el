;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  You can use the commands defined here to select or move to
;;  different kinds of text entities ("things") that are at or near
;;  point.  They are especially useful in combination with Transient
;;  Mark mode.
;; 
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `cycle-thing-region', `mark-enclosing-sexp',
;;    `mark-enclosing-sexp-backward', `mark-enclosing-sexp-forward',
;;    `mark-thing', `next-visible-thing', `next-visible-thing-repeat',
;;    `previous-visible-thing', `previous-visible-thing-repeat',
;;    `select-thing-near-point', `thgcmd-bind-keys', `thing-region'.
;;
;;  User options defined here:
;;
;;    `thing-types'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `thgcmd-bounds-of-thing-at-point', `thgcmd-invisible-p',
;;    `thgcmd-next-visible-thing-1', `thgcmd-next-visible-thing-2',
;;    `thgcmd-repeat-command', `thgcmd-things-alist'.
;;
;;  Internal variables defined here:
;;
;;    `thgcmd-defined-thing-p', `thgcmd-last-thing-type',
;;    `thgcmd-thing-region-index', `thgcmd-thing-region-point'.
;;
;;  Put this in your init file (`~/.emacs'):
;;
;;   (require 'thing-cmds)
;;   (thgcmd-bind-keys) ; Only if you want the key bindings it defines
;;
;;  See also the doc strings of `next-visible-thing' and
;;  `thgcmd-bind-keys', for more information about thing navigation
;;  keys.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2012/08/21 dadams
;;     Call tap-put-thing-at-point-props after load thingatpt+.el.
;; 2012/08/18 dadams
;;     Added: thgcmd-bounds-of-thing-at-point.
;;     bounds-of-thing-at-point -> thgcmd-bounds-of-thing-at-point everywhere.
;; 2012/08/17 dadams
;;     Invoke tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix if thingatpt+.el is loaded.
;;     Require thingatpt.el before thingatpt+.el.
;; 2011/12/15 dadams
;;     mark-thing:
;;       If not on a thing, use thing-region to capture one.  If in a thing and not extending
;;       existing region, then extend region back to beginning. to select the whole thing.
;; 2011/07/02 dadams
;;     Removed autoload cookie from thing-types.  Thx to Michael Heerdegen.
;; 2011/05/24 dadams
;;     thgcmd-invisible-p: Use invisible-p if available (Emacs 22+).
;; 2011/05/14 dadams
;;     Added: thgcmd-things-alist.
;;     thing-region, mark-thing, (next|previous)-visible-thing:
;;       Use thgcmd-things-alist, not thing-types.
;; 2011/05/13 dadams
;;     Added: thgcmd-defined-thing-p (from icicle-defined-thing-p).
;;     Combined thgcmd-last-visible-thing-type and thgcmd-mark-thing-type into
;;       thgcmd-last-thing-type.
;;     Renamed: cycle-thing-region-point to thgcmd-thing-region-point.
;;     thing-types: Default value defined using thgcmd-defined-thing-p, not a constant.
;;     thing-region, mark-thing: Use name of thgcmd-last-thing-type as default value.
;;     thing-region: Save THING as thgcmd-last-thing-type.
;;     (next|previous)-visible-thing: Use completing-read, not read-string.
;;     thgcmd-next-visible-thing-2: Be sure not to return an empty thing ("").
;; 2011/05/11 dadams
;;     Added: thgcmd-invisible-p.
;;     Moved comment hide/show stuff to new library hide-comnt.el, and require that.
;;       ignore-comments-flag, hide/show-comments, with-comments-hidden.
;;     Renamed to use prefix thgcmd-: next-visible-thing-(1|2), last-visible-thing-type,
;;                                    mark-thing-type, thing-region-index
;;     thgcmd-next-visible-thing-2: Separate handling overlay & text prop. Use thgcmd-invisible-p.
;; 2011/05/10 dadams
;;     Added (copied here from icicles-cmd2.el):
;;      ignore-comments-flag, hide/show-comments, last-visible-thing-type, with-comments-hidden, 
;;      next-visible-thing(-1|-2), previous-visible-thing.
;;     Added: thgcmd-repeat-command, thgcmd-bind-keys, (next|previous)-visible-thing-repeat.
;;     Extended (next|previous)-visible-thing to work with thgcmd-repeat-command.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookies for defcustom and commands.
;;     Added groups for defcustom.
;; 2010/12/17 dadams
;;     Added: mark-enclosing-sexp(-forward|-backward).
;; 2008/11/29 dadams
;;     mark-thing: Set point to beginning/end of thing, so whole thing gets marked.
;;                 Make completion default be the first element of thing-types.
;; 2007/07/15 dadams
;;     Added cycle-thing-region-point.
;;     cycle-thing-region: Save point in cycle-thing-region-point and reuse it.
;; 2006/07/30 dadams
;;     Created.

Start at START.  If END is non-nil then look no farther than END.
Interactively:
 - START is point.
 - If the region is not active, END is the buffer end.  If the region
   is active, END is the region end: the greater of point and mark.

Ignores (skips) comments if `ignore-comments-flag' is non-nil.  If you
also use Icicles then you can toggle this ignoring of comments using
`C-M-;' in the minibuffer, but depending on when you do so you might
need to invoke the current command again.

If you use this command or `previous-visible-thing' successively, even
mixing the two, you are prompted for the type of THING only the first
time.  You can thus bind these two commands to simple repeatable
keys (e.g. `f11', `f12'), to navigate among things quickly.

If you do not want to sacrifice two simple repeatable keys for this,
then you can instead use commands `next-visible-thing-repeat' and
`previous-visible-thing-repeat', binding them each to a less rare key
sequence that uses a prefix key.  Command `thgcmd-bind-keys' does
this: it binds them to `C-x down' and `C-x up', so you can repeat them
separately using `C-x down down...' etc.  However, unlike bindings for
`next-visible-thing' and `previous-visible-thing', switching from one
direction to the other requires you to again enter the THING type.

Non-interactively, THING is a symbol, and optional arg BACKWARD means
go to the previous thing.

Return (THING THING-START . THING-END), with THING-START and THING-END
the bounds of THING.  Return nil if no such THING is found."

NOTE concerning the visible-thing navigation keys:

`C-x down' and `C-x up' are bound here (for Emacs 21 and later) to
`next-visible-thing-repeat' and `previous-visible-thing-repeat',
respectively.  This means you can use `C-x down down down...' etc. to
move forward to successive things, and similarly for `C-x up...' and
backward.  You are asked for the thing type only the first time you
hit `down' or `up' after `C-x'.

However, you cannot mix the directions forward/backward without
inputting the thing type again.  For example, If you do `C-x down up',
the `up' does not perform thing navigation (it probably does
`previous-line', the default `up' binding) .

To change direction without getting prompted for the thing type, you
need to bind, not commands `next-visible-thing-repeat' and
`previous-visible-thing-repeat', but commands `next-visible-thing' and
`previous-visible-thing' (no `-repeat' suffix).  Bind these to simple,
repeatable keys, such as `f11' and `f12'.  Because such keys are rare
\(mostly taken already), the only bindings made here for thing
navigation are `C-x down' and `C-x up'."
